1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
    HTTP1.1 is standard protocol ,this has been using more than 15 years till now we are using this protocol only.
    HTTP2 it is using only for greater performance

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
   Object is key-value pairs and we must use colon between key and value, it's separated by commas
For example: var college{
                          name: "st.joseph",
                          principal:" babu "}
                       console.log(college.name)
